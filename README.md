# bmusicfonts

This is a set of hacky fonts for LilyPond, which were designed to provide for consistent and high-quality tpyesetting in LilyPond using the Bravura font design. These fonts are best used alongside a specific group of LilyPond styles (to be released soon) as well as the latest version of the SMuFL Bravura font.

These fonts will probably be mostly obsoleted by the support for SMuFL which is to arrive in a future version of LilyPond. In the meanwhile, for those who want to use Bravura particularly, these fonts help to ensure consistently high-quality scores. Once native SMuFL support is present in LilyPond, it'll likely be best to just use that.
